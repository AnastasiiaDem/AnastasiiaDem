I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate. With over 3 years of coding experience, I specialize in building full-stack applications and interactive web experiences. My toolkit includes React, Angular, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, MongoDB, Git, and more.

What excites me about software development is the thrill of the challenge. I believe there's always a solution, and this inspires me to dive into development with passion and curiosity. I love finding innovative solutions through code, balancing creativity with analytical thinking.
