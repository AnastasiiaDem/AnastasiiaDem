## Hi, I’m Anastasiia 👋 Software Engineer

> *“Programming isn’t about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out.”* — **Chris Pine**
<br>

I’m a **Software Engineer with a Computer Science degree** and hands-on experience building **modern, scalable web applications** from concept to deployment.

I specialize in turning complex requirements into **clean, accessible, and performant user interfaces**, and I’m comfortable working across the full stack when needed. I adapt quickly to new technologies and enjoy solving real-world problems through thoughtful code and design.

I enjoy working on products that require both **analytical thinking and creativity** — whether that’s improving performance, refining UX, or architecting features that scale. I’m especially motivated by projects where I can take ownership and see measurable impact.
